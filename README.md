## Hand Gesture Recognition System

A real-time hand gesture recognition application using OpenCV and MediaPipe that enables intuitive control of media playback and volume through simple hand gestures. This project demonstrates practical applications of computer vision and human-computer interaction by integrating gesture detection with multimedia control.


## Features

Real-time detection and tracking of hand landmarks using MediaPipe Hands.

Gesture-based control for media playback (play/pause) and volume adjustment.

Dynamic volume control using the distance between thumb and index finger.

Play/pause toggle controlled by wrist and middle finger distance.

Integration with VLC Media Player for media playback.

Audio volume control using PyCAW (Windows only).

Visual feedback on screen with annotated hand landmarks and volume bar.

## Technologies Used

Python 3.x

OpenCV

MediaPipe

VLC Media Player (required on host machine)

PyCAW (Python Core Audio Windows library)
